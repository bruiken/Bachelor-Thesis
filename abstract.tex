Many techniques for detecting non-termination in term rewriting systems exist. None of these techniques, however, are adapted to work for many-sorted term rewriting systems. In this paper the unfolding technique is adapted to be able to work with those systems and implemented into a new tool called Mara (MAny-sorted Rewriting Analyser). We will see that we do not need many large changes to make the existing technique work. We have also conducted a number of experiments with variations and limitations to the unfolding technique. From these experiments we were even able to detect non-termination in an example where no other tool has.
