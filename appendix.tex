\chapter{Test Framework}\label{testframework}
The test framework created and used is written in Python and can be found at \url{https://github.com/bornobob/MaraRunner}. It consists of two parts: the runner and the visualiser. The runner takes configurations and tests files, then outputs a JSON file with all the results. The visualiser creates an HTML page with all the results in a table, where the different configurations are split up in columns. 

\chapter{Results}\label{results}
The results from all the experiments were converted to HTML files using the previously mentioned test framework. There are four files: one for the experiments on the termination problem database, two for the confluence database and the last one is for the problems transformed from the higher order database.
