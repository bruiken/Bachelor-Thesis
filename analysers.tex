\chapter{Analysers}\label{analysers}
Before we can implement the non-termination analysers into Mara, we need a basis to implement them onto. This will of course be done as an extension of Cora. Mara can be found on Github:

The analysers we will implement all have the same task and will get as an input only a term rewriting system. The task in our case obviously is checking non-termination. The implementations will only cover many-sorted rewriting systems. The possible results of the analysers come down to four situations: \texttt{YES}, \texttt{NO}, \texttt{MAYBE} and \texttt{TIMEOUT}. These results are also used in competitions where term rewriting systems are analysed\cite{TermPortal}. Note that even though we ask the question ``Does this TRS non-terminate'' in the analysis techniques, the results answer the question ``Does this TRS terminate''. I.e. when a TRS does not terminate, the analyser will result in \texttt{NO}. Also note that after our analysis is done, we cannot just return \texttt{YES}, because there is no technique that encompasses all (non-)termination. 

Since our analysis will only return \texttt{NO}, \texttt{MAYBE} and \texttt{TIMEOUT}, the analyser will use \texttt{NONTERMINATES} instead of \texttt{NO} for clarity.
