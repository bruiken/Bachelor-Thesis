\chapter{Future Work}\label{futurework}
In future work, many other techniques for proving non-termination could be adapted for many-sorted term rewriting systems, most notably the Dependency Pair Framework. The work in this thesis could be translated into a DP processor. It could also be interesting to look at existing termination techniques and adapt them for many-sorted TRSs. 

A second class of rewriting systems to look at, are the string rewriting systems. It could be interesting to look at how sorts impact the (non-)termination analysis on them. 

Of course, the current implementations of the algorithms could also be improved. The implementation for semi-unification is worst case exponential, while polynomial time algorithms exist\cite{SemiUnification}\cite{OLIART2004455}. These have not been used here for the sake of complexity. Also, the abstract unfolding analysis has gotten an improvement in \cite{PAYET:NTI} which could be implemented alongside the existing concrete and abstract unfolders.
