\chapter{Future Work}\label{futurework}
In future work, many other techniques for proving non-termination could be adapted for many-sorted term rewriting systems, most notably the Dependency Pair Framework. This framework has proven to work well in other tools and it can be expanded with processors over time. It could also be interesting to look at the termination side of the analysis. This way, the tool can try to prove both termination and non-termination and thus get to a more complete answer.

A second class of rewriting systems to look at, are the string rewriting systems. It could be interesting to look at how sorts impact the (non-)termination analysis on them. 

Of course, the current implementations of the algorithms could also be improved. The implementation for semi-unification is worst case exponential, while polynomial time algorithms exist\cite{SemiUnification}\cite{OLIART2004455}. Also, the abstract unfolding analysis has gotten an improvement in \cite{PAYET:NTI} which could be implemented next to the existing concrete and abstract unfolders.
